## Cultural Thematic Path Ontology - An ontology to travel in culture  
This repository is dedicated to the development of an ontological module on the creation of cultural thematic path related to the GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museum) domain, serving as a tool to "travel" through the cultural heritage by allowing the linking between cultural resources, of various types and stored in different places, unified by one or more themes.  
The ontological module aims to be autonomous yet easily reusable with other exhisting domain ontologies, widely used in the GLAM sector.  
The development of the ontology on Cultural Thematic Paths follows the Linked Open Terms (LOT) methodology, as outlined by [Poveda-Villal√≥n et al.] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197622000525).  

## Documentation
