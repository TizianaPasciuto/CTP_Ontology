It signified “the science of nature”. While Fontana's appointment in Florence was that of Physicist to the Court, we would say rather, Scientist. The work he projected on the grandest scale, although never completed, was called “Animal Physics”, and his earliest printed work was on physiology, entitled simply “Epistolary Dissertation”, dated 23 may 1757. Among the topics covered are the sensitivity and identification of \"animal spirits\" with electricity. In 1765 Fontana published two works entitled \"The laws of irritability\", focused on the contraction of the muscles by an external stimulus. These topics were treated with greater attention in the publication \"Animal Physics\" of 1775. The scientist also dealt with animal respiration, combining observations in physiology, those in pharmacology and his interest in airs. Starting from the truth accepted as demonstrable that atmospheric air was an indispensable necessity for animal life, he pointed out that there were two different types of air besides atmospheric air. One type concerns both inflammable air and phlogisticated air, namely hydrogen and nitrogen respectively: these airs do not support life, but are in themselves devoid of any harmful principle. Instead, the other type of air included, among others, the fixed air, or carbon dioxide: they were found to be harmful to the body because they attack and harm vital organs. One of Fontana's most important works concerns the movements of the iris: the starting point of this work was the existence of the iris, that is a body that moved responding to light but not to being irritated. The behaviour of the iris was therefore totally different from that of the skeletal muscle.

Tangible heritage such as places of worship, hospitals, accommodation facilities, bridges, as well as non-tangible heritage in the form of myths, legends and songs are present along the Santiago Routes and can be enjoyed by the traveller.\nTravelling today - Each year, hundreds of thousands of travellers set out to make their way to Santiago de Compostela. As there are endless numbers of branches to the route, it is common to begin the journey literally from one's doorstep. Most travel by foot, some by bicycle, and a few travel on horseback or by donkey, as some of their medieval counterparts did."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

His first recorded anatomical research was that concerning the study of the inner ear, testified by his correspondence with Cotugno and Caldani. Instead, the first publication appeared in 1767 and focused on the study of the human testicle: even according to modern opinions it is an excellent description of the epididymis. The Fountain also focused its studies on intercostal nerves: he wrote that the intercostal nerves so nota rise form the sixth pair of cranial nerves but running togheter with them in a common sheath with no interconnections, between cavernous sinus and the orbit. Fontana's efforts convinced the Italian anatomists, they dispelled the confusion of centuries which had arisen partly from differences in the numbering of the cranial nerves. There were numerous studies on nerves in general and on their reproduction. One of Fontana's best–known works in anatomy was his description of a canal in the eye of the ox: his study will lead to the definition of a structure in the human eye. Many important studies with the microscope were made by Fontana: the first published was about the red globules of the blood. Of all the human tissues at which the microscope has been directed, blood has undoubtedly been the most frequently examined, since it is readily available in a fresh state and requires no complicated handling. Fontana discovered that the red blood cells have a spheroid shape, more swollen along the external surface: instead the previous studies, operated by the Neapolitan histologist Giovanni Maria Della Torre, claimed that the corpuscles were ring–shaped or \"doughnuts\". Fontana conducted the same observations as Della Torre, with the same type of lenses and microscope but, by varying the illumination, discovered the true shape of the blood corpuscles. \nBibliography: Fontana, Felice, Nuove osservazioni sopra i globetti rossi del sangue, Lucca, Giusti, 1766.

At what point is an animal dead, rather than alive? What is death? What is life? Searching for answers to these questions led him down other paths in biology, such as the study of animals which die and revive (anabiosis).During his life, he also studied the so–called American poison, also known by the names Ticunas, Woorara or Curaro.

Much had been written about this poison, and Fontana's first effort was to dispel the error that had been spread, that the very smell of it was noxious, as written by Gomara in 1554, according to Benedicenti, or as in La Condamine's story that \"this poison is prepared by women condamned to death; and they determine its having attained its point of perfection, when the vapor it emits, during the boiling, kills the person who attends it\". Fontana found that the smoke or vapor from it did no harm to a pigeon, nor to him nauseous and disagreeable though it was. He found that \"the American poison takne internally, is a poison, but that a considerable quantity of it is required to kill even a small animal\". Among the most dangerous poisons studied by Fontana appears the cherry–Laurel. The reason given by Fontana for studying the cherry–laurel was as follows: “ this oil […] is one of the most terrible and deadly poisons known. This important truth will, I hope, destroy once for all the abuse that has crept into several places in Italy, of selling the oil of the cherry–laurel publicly in the shops, to all those who ask for it.” Although many previous works were available to substantiate this thesis, Fontana developed his considerations without mentioning any, following only his principles and formulating various preparations of cherry–laurel for his experiments.\nBibliography: Benedicenti, Alberico, Malati, Medici, e Farmacisti, 2nd ed., Milan, Hoepli, 1951.
